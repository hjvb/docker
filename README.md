docker
======
This is a personal git repo for my docker images. Feel free to use/reuse

Most images use a directory in /config (see dockerfile) on the host system mounted on /config or something usefull to store statefull config data. All data itself is mounted seperately, TV to /data/TV, etc, etc. 

#docker
